M_steelBrick_1_1_1 - Linear-elastic uni-axial loading
M_steelBrick_1_2_1 - Plastic-elastic uni-axial loading

M_steelBrick_2_1_1 - NN model works without bugs. only takes one data file as input though.
M_steelBrick_2_1_2 - modified to work with multiple input files with different stress ratios
M_steelBrick_2_2_1 - Linear elastic biaxial case
M_steelBrick_2_3_1 - Plastic-elastic biaxial case

M_steelBrick_2d_main_1         - Debugged and modified to work with linear-elastic and plastic-elastic data
M_steelBrick_2d_main_2         - Rearranged and modified to work with biaxial tension/compression

M_compBrick_2d_main_1         - Strain controlled!! Specifically modified for composite plate with a hole (and Hashin damage)
M_compBrick_2d_main_2         - Stress controlled version
M_compBrick_2d_main_3         - Modified network inputs (added damage parameter)
M_compBrick_2d_main_4         - Modified network inputs (added historic stress-strain states)
M_compBrick_2d_main_5         - Includes Shear
